# SETUP
Load libraries
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
```

Load tour data
```{r load}
stage_cyc <- read_csv("plot_data/tour_data_plus_calc.csv")
```

Create network graph showing edges between start and end locations of each stage of every Tour.
```{r network}
set.seed(123)

stage_cyc %>%
  filter(year > 1990) %>%
  count(start_place, end_place, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n >= 2) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(colour = "lightblue", size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), just = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```
